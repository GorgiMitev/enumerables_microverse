## Bubble_sort method

In this project I was making two bubble sort methods using ruby.

1. bubble_sort
2. bubble_sort_by

[x] Created the linters file required
[x] Created the first method
[x] Run the tests of the first method
 ``` p bubble_sort([1, 3, 2, 7, 6]) ```
[x] Created the second method
[x] Run the tests of the second method
 ``` p  bubble_sort_by(["halloween","hi","hello","hey"]) { |left,right| left.length - right.length } ```
[x] Created the readme file
